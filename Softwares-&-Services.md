1. Sysmon
Sysmon (System Monitor) is a Windows system service and device driver that logs detailed activity on a system, such as process creation, network connections, and registry modifications. It is widely used in cybersecurity for detecting malicious activities and persistent threats. Sysmon logs are stored in the Windows Event Log and can be analyzed using tools like SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions. It helps in forensic analysis by providing deep visibility into system behavior.

2. Wazuh
Wazuh is an open-source security platform that provides threat detection, integrity monitoring, vulnerability assessment, and log analysis. It functions as a SIEM solution and can monitor endpoints, cloud environments, and containers. Wazuh integrates with Elasticsearch and Kibana for log storage and visualization. It is commonly used for compliance audits, intrusion detection, and security monitoring in enterprise environments.

3. Digital Ocean
DigitalOcean is a cloud computing platform that provides virtual private servers (Droplets), managed databases, Kubernetes, and scalable storage solutions. It is known for its simplicity, developer-friendly interface, and cost-effectiveness compared to competitors like AWS and Azure. DigitalOcean is widely used for hosting websites, running applications, and deploying cloud infrastructure. It also offers networking solutions like load balancers and VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds).

4. Cassandra
Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable, distributed NoSQL database designed for handling large amounts of data across multiple servers with no single point of failure. It is used in applications requiring high availability and fault tolerance, such as real-time analytics, IoT, and big data applications. Cassandra uses a peer-to-peer architecture and is favored by organizations like Netflix and Facebook.

5. Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is an open-source search and analytics engine used for log analysis, full-text search, and data visualization. It is based on the Lucene search engine and is commonly used in SIEM solutions, observability, and business intelligence. It enables real-time data querying and integrates with the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for log management and security monitoring.

6. TheHive
TheHive is an open-source Security Incident Response Platform (SIRP) used by SOCs and CERTs for investigating and managing cybersecurity incidents. It allows analysts to collaborate on cases, collect and enrich threat intelligence, and integrate with tools like MISP and Cortex for automated analysis. TheHive improves the efficiency of incident response teams by providing structured case management.

7. Shuffle
Shuffle is an open-source security automation and orchestration tool (SOAR) that helps in automating security workflows. It enables cybersecurity teams to integrate various tools, automate repetitive tasks, and improve threat response times. It supports no-code/low-code workflows, allowing analysts to create automation pipelines without programming skills. Shuffle is used for tasks like incident triage, threat intelligence enrichment, and log analysis.

8. Mimikatz Telemetry
Mimikatz is a well-known post-exploitation tool used for credential dumping and privilege escalation in Windows environments. Mimikatz telemetry refers to tracking and monitoring Mimikatz-related activity within an environment to detect unauthorized access attempts. Security tools like Sysmon, SIEMs, and EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions can help identify Mimikatz attacks by analyzing process execution and system logs.

9. VirusTotal
VirusTotal is an online threat intelligence platform that allows users to analyze suspicious files, URLs, and IP addresses against multiple antivirus engines and reputation databases. It helps cybersecurity professionals identify malware, detect phishing domains, and gather threat intelligence. VirusTotal also provides API access for automated malware analysis and integrates with security tools for enhanced detection capabilities.
